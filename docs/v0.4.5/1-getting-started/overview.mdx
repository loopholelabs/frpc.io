At its core, **Frisbee** is best described as a `bring-your-own-protocol{:.keyword}` messaging framework. Our goal was
to make it possible for Developers to define their **own** messaging patterns and protocols, and have the actual
lower-level implementations done for them by the library.

**FRPC** (or **Frisbee RPC**), on the other hand, is an <Tooltip text={"Remote Procedure Call"} content={"RPC"}/> Framework (similar to [GRPC](https://grpc.io) or
[Apache Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/)) that uses the Frisbee messaging framework as its underlying transport mechanism.

We built <Tooltip text={"Frisbee RPC"} content={"FRPC"}/> because we loved the idea of defining our message types in a standardized
[proto3](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3) format and having the [protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) compiler generate all the necessary
glue code for us, but we didn't like the [overhead](https://github.com/boguslaw-wojcik/encoding-benchmarks) of encoding and decoding
messages in the <Tooltip text={"Data format used to serialize structured data"} content={"protobuf"}/> format, and wanted a wire protocol that was lighter than <Tooltip text={"Wire format used for GRPC"} content={"HTTP\/2"}/>.

<Tooltip text={"Frisbee RPC"} content={"FRPC"} /> works by making use of protobuf
plugins, and allows developers to use their existing proto3 files to generate a full
RPC Framework that uses Frisbee under the hood. Moreover, Frisbee is a **drop-in
replacement for GRPC** thanks to our generated interfaces matching GRPC's, and in
an apples-to-apples comparison, [FRPC blows GRPC's performance out of the water]().

Over the next few pages we'll walk you through the process of getting started with <Tooltip text={"Frisbee RPC"} content={"FRPC"}/>,
from defining your message types in a <Tooltip text={"Syntax used to describe protocol buffers"} content={"proto3"}/> file, to writing your first server and client.

We'll also introduce the core concepts around Frisbee as well as how you can use the Framework to build your own messaging protocols.
